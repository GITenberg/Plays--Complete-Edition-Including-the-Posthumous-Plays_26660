<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><cite>The Power of Darkness</cite>, Tolstoy's first and greatest play,
was not written until he was fifty-eight years of age, and
it was not allowed to be performed in Russia till some
years later. Both there and elsewhere abroad it was
highly successful on the stage, as was also the comedy,
<cite>Fruits of Culture</cite>, which he wrote three years later, to be
performed by his own family and their friends.</p>

<p>The only other play published during his lifetime,
<cite>The First Distiller</cite>, is a very slight piece of no particular
dramatic importance. It was written in the cause
of temperance.</p>

<p>Besides these, he left three other plays finished, or
nearly finished, when he died.</p>

<p><cite>The Live Corpse</cite> (which in English has also been called
<cite>The Man who was Dead</cite>) is the one best adapted for the
stage. <cite>The Cause of it All</cite> is, like <cite>The First Distiller</cite>, a short
and unimportant piece dealing with the effects of drink.
The most interesting, not dramatically but psychologically,
of the three is <cite>The Light Shines in Darkness</cite>, which
was left in an unfinished state. In it Tolstoy presents
his own case, and deals with the contradiction that existed
and has so often been commented on, between practice
and theory in his own life and teaching.</p>

<p>For the purpose of the play he greatly simplified his
own highly complex personality, and, though many of the
details and characters are drawn from life with extraordinary
exactitude, the picture presented is not one which
all the people concerned are disposed to regard as quite
fair to themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x">x</a></span>
The play presents the terrible clash which resulted
from the calls Tolstoy made on himself and on others to
abandon all customary ways of life and to start afresh in
a new direction. In his own case he was never allowed
to test the effects of a life of extreme poverty and
manual labour, such as he advocated; nor did those of his
followers who adopted such a life achieve much success
therein. Tolstoy's artistic sincerity is indeed shown by the
fact that, despite his spiritual fervour and his profound conviction
that he had really found the road to salvation for
mankind, he has not, in this play, minimised the failure
of his efforts to carry convictions to those about him, or
to achieve any other success than that of obtaining an
inward assurance that he was fulfilling the will of God.
This assurance would, no doubt, have been more fully indicated
in the last act, had he lived to complete it.</p>

<p>Tolstoy was well aware of the advantages a play
possesses over a novel as a means of propaganda, and but
for the existence of the Censorship he would have written
more for the stage. When asked, in 1892, whether he
would write any more plays, he replied: &ldquo;I would
do so with great pleasure, and I even feel a special
need to express myself in that way; but I feel certain
the Censor would not pass my plays. You would not
believe how, from the very commencement of my activity,
that horrible Censor question has tormented me! I
wanted to write what I felt; but at the same time I felt
that what I wrote would not be permitted; and involuntarily
I abandoned the work. I abandoned, and went on
abandoning, and meanwhile the years passed away.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 4em; margin: 2em -4em 2em 0em;">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

<p>There is one other matter of some importance on
which I must here say a word.</p>

<p>No accepted standard of transliteration for Russian
names into English has hitherto existed. Each writer has
been a law unto himself. Now, at last, the Liverpool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi">xi</a></span>School of Russian Studies has prepared and privately circulated
a scheme, which deserves to be, and is likely to be,
generally adopted. It differs in some particulars from the
plan I have followed heretofore; but the advantage to
Anglo-Russian literature of the general adoption of a
uniform and authoritative rule will be so great that I
hasten to put myself in accord with the Liverpool scheme,
without even waiting for it to be publicly promulgated.</p>

<p>The result of so doing however is that in the three
earlier plays now reprinted from stereotype plates the
transliteration does not quite coincide with the plan
adopted in the three freshly translated plays. For this
discrepancy I must ask the readers' kind indulgence.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
